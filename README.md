# Planning, Control, and Simulation of a UR5 Robot Manipulator
Goal: To implement a simple path planner, inverse kinematics function, controller, and simulation for the UR5 robot manipulator.
The final project for the Ohio State University class, Real Time Robotics (ME5463).

### Team Member Responsibilities:
PD Controller - Michael Napoli  
Inverse Kinematics - Michael Napoli  
Path Planner - Dylan Trainor  
Environment/Simulation - Jesse Zhang, Chunhui Wang  

### Components Missing:
1). Obstacle detection for UR5 links (EE obstacle detector present).
2). 3D path planner (current planner uses stitched together 2D paths).
3). More sophisticated torque controller.
4). UR5 links tend towards downward position (through table), see item 1.
5). etc...
